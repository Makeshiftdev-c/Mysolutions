# Mysolutions
Starts at chapter 3 and doesn't include system implementation specific explorative projects (such as Chapter 7, Programming Project 1); I'm running a 32 bit compiler on a 64 bit architecture, worse yet the compiler can't seem to decide whether it supports the c89 or c99 standard. (May inlcude projects from pre-chapter 3 at a later date.) Code could also be optimised and/or improved for some of the projects. The repository will be updated as I work my way through the book, as I'm new to programming.
