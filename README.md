# Mysolutions

<u>Background:</u>  
  
Doesn't include a few programming projects. The compiler is configured to default; supports all C89 standard (international standard ISO/IEC 9899:1990) features and some C99 standard (international standard ISO/IEC 9899:1999) features. (May inlcude absent projects pre- and post-chapter 3 at a later date.) Code could be improved for some of the projects. The repository will be updated as I work through the book, and improvements made on subsequent iterations.
