# Mysolutions
Starts at chapter 3 and doesn't include system implementation specific explorative projects. (May inlcude projects from pre-chapter 3 at a later date.) Code could also be optimised and/or improved for some of the projects. The repository will be updated as I work my way through the book, as I'm new to programming.
