# Mysolutions

<u>Background:</u>  
  
Starts at chapter 3 and doesn't include a few programming projects; I'm running a 32 bit compiler on a x86_64 architecture and operating system, the compiler is configured to the C89 standard (international standard ISO/IEC 9899:1990). (May inlcude absent projects pre- and post-chapter 3, at a later date.) Code could be optimised and/or improved for some of the projects. The repository will be updated as I work through the book.
