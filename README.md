# Mysolutions

<u>Background:</u>  
  
Starts at chapter 3 and doesn't include a few programming projects; I'm running a 32 bit compiler on a x64 architecture and operating system (specifically, Windows 10 x64 OS), the compiler is configured to the C89 standard (international standard ISO/IEC 9899:1990). (May inlcude absent projects from pre- and post-chapter 3 at a later date.) Code could also be optimised and/or improved for some of the projects. The repository will be updated as I work through the book.
