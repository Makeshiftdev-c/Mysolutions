Question Specification:  
  
Write a program that sorts a series of words entered by the  
user. Assume that each word is no more than 20 characters  
long. Stop reading when the user enters an empty word (i.e.  
presses Enter without entering a word). Store each word in a  
dynamically allocated string, using an array of pointers to  
keep track of the strings, as in the remind2.c progam (Section  
17.2). After all words have been read, sort the array (using  
any sorting technique) and then use a loop to print the words  
in sorted order. Hint: Use the read_line function to read each  
word as in remind2.c.
