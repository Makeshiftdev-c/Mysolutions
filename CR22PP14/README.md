Question Specification:  
  
Modify Programming Project 15 from Chapter 8 so that the program prompts  
the user to enter the name of a file containing the message to be  
encrypted:  
<pre>
Enter name of file to be encrypted: message.txt  
Enter shift amount (1-25): 3  
</pre>  
The Program then writes the encrypted message to a file with the same  
name but an added extension of .enc. In this example, the original file  
is message.txt, so the encrypted message will be stored in a file named  
message.txt.enc. There's no limit on the size of the file to be  
encrypted or on the length of each line in the file.
