Question Specification:  
  
Suppose that money is deposited into a savings account and left for t years. Assume that the  
annual interest is r and that interest is compounded continuously. The formula *A*<sub>*(t)*</sub> *= Pe*<sup>*rt*</sup>  
can be used to calculate the final value of the account, where P is the original amount  
deposited. For example, $1000 left on deposit for 10 years at 6% interest would be worth  
$1000 x e<sup>0.06x10</sup> = $1000 x e<sup>0.6</sup> = $1000 x 1.8221188 = $1,822.12. Write a program that dis-  
plays the result of this calculation after prompting the user to enter the original amount  
deposited, the interest rate, and the number of years.
